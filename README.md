#Future Plans

Things that can be done to further improve the website is-
 - Instead of showing all the users available, make a friend-request system so that an user will only have those users who they actually know. 
 - Create a profile page for the user
 - Make a notification feature i.e when someone has messaged the user and he hasn't seen it yet, there will be some kind of notification which will notify the user
 that they have unchecked messages.
 - Add group chat functionality
 - Add a feature to send photos and files
